Design and create a RESTful API in ASP.NET Core. The API should call, combine, and return these 2 API endpoints into a single HTTP response. Your API should consist of 2 operations; one to return all the data from the above endpoints, and one to return data relating to a single User Id. • http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos • http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums

Requirements •
/ Your API should be written in C# 
• You should use either .NET Core 3.1 or .NET 5 
• You may use any IDE, but you must supply a valid .sln file

• Your solution must compile and run in a single step 
• Avoid including artefacts from your local build, e.g. NuGet packages, bin/obj folders • You should upload your code to GitHub, or supply a download link to a ZIP file from OneDrive

TODO comments: Lots of improements with respect to code optimization is yet to done.
